"""

Itâ€™s a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, 
while allowing subclasses to override specific steps of that algorithm without changing its structure.

ðŸ§  The Core Idea

Youâ€™ve got an overall process (a template) that never changes â€” a sequence of operations that must happen in a certain order.
But some steps vary depending on context, environment, or data.

So instead of rewriting the entire process every time, you:

Put the common steps in a base class.

Leave hook methods (abstract or overridable) for the variable steps.

Let subclasses fill in the details.
