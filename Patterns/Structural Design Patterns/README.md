Structural Design Patterns

🏗️ What Are Structural Design Patterns?

Structural patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
Think of them as the architectural blueprints that help you build software where the walls fit, the doors open, and the plumbing doesn’t leak.

They help answer questions like:

How can I combine objects to get new functionality without rewriting existing code?
How can I make incompatible classes work together?
How can I simplify a system of interconnected parts?

🧩 The Core Idea

Structural design patterns focus on relationships — inheritance and composition — to make systems:

Flexible: easy to change without rewriting everything.
Re-usable: same component used in multiple contexts.
Decoupled: components don’t depend on each other’s messy internals.

They basically teach your classes to play nicely without fighting over control.
