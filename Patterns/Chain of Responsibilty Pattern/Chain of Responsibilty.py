Chain of Responsibility

Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon
receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.


This pattern is used in the following cases:

        * More than one object may handle a request, and the handler isnâ€™t known a priori. The handler should be ascertained
        automatically.
        * You want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly.
        * The set of objects that can handle a request should be specified dynamically.

Example:
    ATM Dispenser
    * ATM Dispenser has 3 handlers, for 100, 50 and 20 notes.
    * Each handler has a successor, which is the next handler in the chain.
    * When a request is made, the ATM dispenser checks if it can dispense the requested amount.
    * If it can, it dispenses the amount and returns.
    * If it cannot, it passes the request to the next handler in the chain.
    * This continues until the request is handled or the chain ends.
    * If the chain ends without handling the request, the ATM dispenser cannot dispense the amount.
